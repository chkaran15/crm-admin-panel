# `src/routes` Directory

This directory defines the application's routes using [TanStack Router](https://tanstack.com/router). Each file or folder represents a route configuration.

## Structure

```
src/routes/
├── dashboard/
│   └── route.tsx
├── users/
│   └── route.tsx
├── settings/
│   └── route.tsx
```

- Each folder under `src/routes` corresponds to a route in the application.
- The `route.tsx` file in each folder defines the route's component and configuration for TanStack Router.
- Nested routes can be created by adding subfolders with their own `route.tsx` files.

Refer to the TanStack Router documentation for advanced routing patterns.
