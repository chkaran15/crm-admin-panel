# hooks

This directory contains reusable React hooks that can be shared across different parts of the CRM frontend panel. Add any custom hooks here to promote code reuse and maintainability throughout the application.

## Example Folder Structure

```
src/
    hooks/
        useAuth.ts
        useMobile.ts

```

- `useAuth.ts`: Handles authentication logic.
- `useMobile.ts`: Detects and manages mobile device-specific behavior.

Add new hooks as separate files within this directory. Each hook should be documented with usage examples and a description of its purpose.
