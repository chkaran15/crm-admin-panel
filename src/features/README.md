# src/features

This directory contains feature-specific modules, each organized in its own folder. Each feature directory may include its own components, hooks, assets, and other related files as needed.

Example structure:

```
src/features/
├── authentication/
│   ├── assets/
│   ├── components/
│   └── hooks/
├── dashboard/
│   ├── components/
│   └── hooks/
└── user-management/
    ├── assets/
    ├── components/
    └── hooks/
```

Organize each feature to encapsulate its logic and UI, following the structure that best fits the feature's requirements.
