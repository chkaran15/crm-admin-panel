# src/constants

This directory contains constant values used throughout the CRM frontend application. By centralizing constants here, the codebase remains organized and maintainable. Typical contents include:

- **Directory paths:** Centralized references to important folders (e.g., root, config, logs, cache).
- **Configuration values:** Static settings used across multiple modules.
- **Reusable enums and keys:** Shared identifiers for actions, statuses, or types.

Keeping constants in one place ensures consistency and simplifies updates across the project.
